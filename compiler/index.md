# Installing dependencies

To run the compiler, the following dependencies are required:

- LLVM/MLIR
- Torch-MLIR
- CIRCT

These can be installed by running `./install-dependencies.sh` in the current directory (`compiler/`).

Installing these requires `cmake`, `git`, `ninja`.

# Running the compiler

To run the compiler, run `./compile <TBD>`. This should generate a `*.v` file.
